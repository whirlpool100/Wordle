Wordle_01 was the a recreation of the famous word game that became very popular from the start of 2022. It was another collaboration with my brother on terminal based games.

Wordle_02 was a revamped version of Wordle_01. I had learnt how to read and write to files as such replacing the myriad lines of code filled with words. Replacing the many lines of words meant for the game with .txt files. In this version, I had also tried using turtle graphics to make the game have a nicer interface for users. However, this project is still in the works and I hope to finish it soon.
